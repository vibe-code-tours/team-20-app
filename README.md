## Prerequisites

### 1. Node.js (Required)

```bash
node --version  # v20+ required
npm --version
```

### 2. MySQL

A running MySQL instance is required for the backend database.

### 3. Git

```bash
git --version
```

---

## Quickstart

Keep this Quickstart working — it's how a new teammate onboards in 5 minutes.

```bash
git clone <repo-url> && cd <repo>
cp .env.example .env                    # fill in real values LOCALLY — never commit .env
cd app && npm install                   # install all dependencies (workspaces)
```

Create a `.env` file inside `app/packages/server`:

```env
DATABASE_URL="mysql://user:your_password@localhost:3306/fundraising"
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
MY_AWS_REGION=your_region
MY_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_key
MY_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret
MY_AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket
```

Replace with your actual credentials.

Run database migrations

```bash
cd app/packages/server && npx prisma migrate dev
```

Add sample data

Reference files:
[Sample Data](./app/packages/server/docs/sample-data.sql)
[Sample Data](./app/packages/server/docs/migration_add_july2026_menu_items.sql)

Run both files from the project root:

```bash
mysql -u your_username -p your_database_name < app/packages/server/docs/sample-data.sql
mysql -u your_username -p your_database_name < app/packages/server/docs/migration_add_july2026_menu_items.sql
```

Replace your_username and your_database_name with your actual MySQL credentials.

From the project root, run both simultaneously:

```bash
cd app
npm run dev
```

This uses `concurrently` to start the backend on `http://localhost:3000` and the frontend on `http://localhost:5173` or `http://localhost:5174`.

Or start them individually:

```bash
# Backend only
cd app/packages/server && npm run dev

# Frontend only
cd app/packages/client && npm run dev
```

This repo was created from the **Vibe Code Tours project starter**. It ships with:

**First thing to do:** follow [`SETUP.md`](./SETUP.md) — a ~1-hour checklist to turn it all on.

**Git rule:** branch → PR → 1 teammate review → merge. No push to `main`, no self-merge.

> A green pipeline ≠ secure. Scanners catch leaked keys, known-CVE deps, and injection
> patterns. They do **not** catch prompt-injection, over-scoped tokens, or hallucinated
> packages — a human still reviews for those.
